          In BJJ each day is a day: if yesterday I beat an opponent, tomorrow he might find a way to surprise me. He will also evolve in time and try to create some difficulties. Thus Iâ€™m always looking forward to competing, be it against the new guys or my old rivals, to see whether my game still works against them.
